## Topic Objectives
* Learn more than transforming E-R data models into relational designs
* Review the normalization process
* Understand the need of denormalization
* Know how to implement 1:1, 1:N, and N:M binary relationships
* Know how to implement 1:1, 1:N, and N:M recursive relationships
* Learn SQL statement for creating  joins over binary and recursive relationships

### From Relations to Entities to Tables
* Item(itemId, description, cost, listPrice, quantityOnHand)

### Transitioning from a Data Model to a Database
* Create a table for each entity
    * A table has a descriptive name and a set of attributes that together describe the entity
* Specify a primary key
* Specify column properties
    * Data type
    * Null status
    * Default values (if any)
    * Data constraints (if any)
* The relation is then analyzed using the normalization rules
* As normalization issues arise, the initial design may need to be modified

## Normalization Review

### Modification Anomalies
* Table that are not normalized are susceptible to experiencing modification anomalies
    * Insertion problems
        * Difficulties inserting data into a relation
    * Update problems
        * Difficulties modifying data in a relation
    * Deletion problems
        * Difficulties deleting data from a relation

#### Solving Modification Anomalies
* Most Modification problems are solved by breaking an existing table into two or more table through a process known as *normalization*


### Definitions
* Functional dependency
    * The relationship (within the relation) that describe how the value of one attribute may be used to find the value of another attribute
* Determinant
    * An attribute that can be used to find the value of another attribute in the relation
* Candidate key
    * The value of a candidate key can be used to find the value of every other non-key attribute in the table
    * A simple candidate key consists of only one attribute
    * A composite candidate key consists of more than one attribute


### Normal Forms
* Many normal forms have been defined:
    * First Normal Form (1NF)
    * Second Normal Form (2NF)
    * Third Normal Form (3NF)
    * Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
    * Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
    * Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
    * Domain/Key Normal Form (DKNF)
    * Sixth Normal Form (6NF)

### Normalized Relations
* For our purposes, a relation is considered normalized when every determinant is a candidate key
    * Techincally, this is Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
        * Sometimes called 3.5NF
        * Slightly more stringent than 3NF
* A database in 3NF (or above) is generally not susceptible to modification anomalies

### Normalization Example
```
Customer(customerId, name, address, city, state, zip, accountantId, accountantName, accountantPhone)

zip --> (city, state)
accountantId --> (accountantName, accountantPhone)
```

## Denormalization
* Normalizing relations (or breaking them apart into many component relations) may significantly increase the complexity of the data structure
* The question is one of balance:
    * Trading complexity for modification problems and  speed
        * Joining many tables together takes time, and therefore slows the query process
 * There are many situations in which denormalized relations are preferred


### Denormailized Set of Tables
```
Customer(customerId, name, address, city, state, zip, accountId)

Accountant(accountantId, accountantName, accountantPhone)
```

### Denormalization Benefits
* Simplicity
* Improved query performance

### Denormalization Costs
* Modification anomalies
* Redundant data
* More storage space is required

## Representing Relationships
### 1:1 Relationships
* The maximum cardinality determines how a relationship is represented
* 1:1 relationship
    * The key from one relation is placed in the other as a foreign key
    * It both sides of the relationship are optinoal, it does not matter which table receives the foreign key
    * If only one side of the relationship is optinoal, the optinoal side receives the foreign key

```sql
SELECT  *
FROM    Locker L, Employee E
WHERE   L.lockerId = E.lockerId;

SELECT  *
FROM    Locker L, Employee E
WHERE   L.employeeId = E.employeeId;
```

### 1:N Relationships
* Like a 1:1 relationship, a 1:N relationship is implemented by placing the primary key form one table into another table as a foreign key
* However, in a 1:N the foreign key always goes into the *many* side of the relationship
    * The 1 side is called the parent
    * The N side is called the child

```sql
SELECT  *
FROM    Team T, Player P
WHERE   T.teamId = P.teamId
```

### N:M Relationships
* To implement a N:M relationship, a new table is created.
    * This table is called an intersection table or an associated entity  
* An intersection table typically has a composite key comprised of the keys form each of the table to which it is connected
    * A surrogate key may also be used, but this has important implications...

```sql
SELECT  *
FROM    Student S, Class C, Stuedent_Class SC
WHERE   S.SID = SC.SID
    AND     SC.ClassNumber = c.classNumber;
```

### Association Relationships
* When an intersection table has additional attributes beyond those that comprise the primary key, the relationship is called an association relationship



### Surrogate Keys and Associative Entities
* When an associative entity uses a composite primary key composed of the primary keys of its parent tables, each possible matched pair of values  can appear only one in the associative entity
* When an associative entity uses a surrogage key, however, each possible matched pair of values can appear many times in the associative entity.


### Recursive Relationships
* A recursive relationship occurs when a table is related to itself
* Recursive relationship adhere to the same rules as binary relationships.
    * 1:1 and 1:N recursive relationships are implemented using foreign keys
    * N:M recursive relationships are implemented by creating an intersection table


```sql
#1:1
SELECT  *
FROM    PERSON1 AS A, PERSON1 AS B
WHERE   A.PERSON = B.PersonSponsored;

SELECT *
FROM    PERSON2 AS C, RERSON2 AS D
WHERE   C.Person = D.PersonSponsoredBy;

#1:N
SELECT  *
FROM    CUSTOMER AS A, CUSTOMER AS B
WHERE   A.CustomerNumber = B.ReferredBy;

#N:M
SELECT  *
FROM    DOCTOR AS A,
        DOCTOR AS B,
        TREATMENT - INTERSECTION
WHERE   A.Name = TREATMENT - INTERSECTION.Physician AND TREATMENT - INTERSECTION.Patient = B.Name;
```
