## Three Stages of Database Development
* Requirements Analysis Stage
* Component Design Stage
* Implementation Stage

### The Requirements Analysis Stage
* Sources of requirements
    * User Interviews
    * Forms
    * Reports
    * Queries
    * Use Cases
    * Business Rules
    * Observation
    * JAD Sessions

Understanding the data problem

## Requirements Become the E-R Data Model
* After the requirements have been gathered, they are transformed into any Entity Relationship (E-R) Data Model
* E-R Models consist of
    * Entities
    * Attributes
        * Identifiers (Keys)
        * Non-key attributes
    * Relationships

### Entity Class vs. Entity Instance
* Any entity class is a description of the structure and format of the occurrences of the entity
    * Similar to a recipe or architectural blueprints
* An entity Instance is a specific occurrences of an entity class

### Attributes
* Entities have attributes that together describe the entity
    * Examples:
        * projectName
        * startDate
        * projectType
        * projectDescription
* Each attribute has a data type and other properties

#### Identifiers (Keys)
* Entity instances have identifiers (keys)
    * Keys are a type of attribute!
* A key will identiry a specific instances in the entity class
    * socialSecurityNumber
    * studentId
    * employeeId
    * emailAddress
    * departmentId

##### Reminder: Types of Keys
* Uniqueness
    * Keys may be unique or non-unique
    * If the key is unique, the data value for the key must be unique among all instances of the entity
* Composite
    * A composite key consists of two or more attributes
        * e.g., Flight Number & Flight Date


| EmployeeId | Name | PhoneNumber | DepartmentID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 101 | Dan | 714-555-7270 | 1 |
| 102 | Fry | 657-555-6561 | 2 |
| 103 | Leela | 303-555-3247 | 2 |
| 104 | Bender | 480-555-4439 | 2 |

`EmployeeId` is uniqure value, `DepartmentID` is non-unique value

## Relationships
* Recall that entities can be connected to each other in relationships
* The *degree* of the relationship defines the number of entity classes that participate in the relationship
    * Degree 1 is a `unary` relationship
    * Degree 2 is a `binary` relationship
    * Degree 3 is a `ternary` relationship

### Conceptual Crow's Foot Relationship Symbols
* One: `-------`
* Many: `------<-`

### One-to-One Binary Relationship
* 1:1 (one-to-one)
    * A single entity instance in one entity class is related to a single entity instance in another entity class
        * An employee may have no more than one locker
        * A locker may only be used by one employee

* `Employee` ---- `Locker`

```flow
op1=>operation: Employee
op2=>operation: Locker
op1->op2
```

### One-to-Many Binary Relationship
* 1:N (one-to-many)
    * A single entity instance in one entity class is related to many entity instance in another entity class
        * An employee works in one department
        * A department can have many employees

* `Employee` ->------`Deparement`


### Conceptual Many-to-Many Binary Relationship
* N:M (conceptual many-to-many)
    * Many entity instance in one entity class are related to many entity instances in another entity class
        * A supplier may supply several items
        * A particular item may be supplied be several suppliers

* `Item` ->----<- `Supplier`


---
## Cardinality
### Maximum Cardinality
* Relationships are named and classified by their cardinalities, which is a word that means *count* (as in the number of items in a set)
* Each of the three types of binary relationships shown previously has a different *maximum carinality*
* Maximum cardinality is the maximum number of entity instances that can participate in a relationship instance
    * *one, many* or some other positive fixed number

### Minimum Cardinality
* Minimum cardinality is the minimum number of entity instances that *must* participate in a relationship instance
* These values typically assume a value of zero (optinoal) or one (mandatory)

### Crow's Foot Symbols with cardinalities
* One-and-Only-One: `—————|—|——`, minimum cardinality
* One-to-Many: `----|-<-`, maximum cardinality
* Zero-to-One: `----O-|-`
* Zero-to-Many: `----O<-`

### Cardinality Example
* Maximum cardinality is many for Order and one for Customer
* Minimum carinality is one for both Order and Customer
    * Each customer can place one or more orders
    * Each order is associated with one and only one customer

* `Customer` -|-|-------|-<- `Order`


### Entity-Relationship diagrams
* The diagrams in previous slides are called entity-relationship diagram
    * Entities represented by `rectangles`
    * Relationships represented by `lines`
    * cardinalities represented by `Crow's Foot Symbols`

### HAS-A Relationships
* The relationships in the previous slides are called HAS-A relationships
* The term is used because each entity instance *has* a relationship to a second entity instance
    * An employee has a locker
    * A locker has an employee
* There are also IS-A relationships
    * Discussed later...

### Strong and Weak Entities
* A weak entity is an entity whose instances cannot exist in the database without the existence of an instance of another entity
* Any entity that is not a weak entity is called a strong entity
    * Instances of a strong entity can exist in the database independently

### ID-Dependent Weak Entities
* An ID-Dependent weak entity is a weak entity that cannot exit without its parent entity
* This requirement is enforced by using a composite key for the weak entity
    * The first part of the key is the key for the strong entity
    * The second part of the key is the key for the weak entity itself


### Weak Entity Relationships
* The relationship between a strong and weak entity is termed an identifying relationship if the weak entity is ID-dependent
    * Represented by a *solid* line
* The relationship between a strong and weak entity is termed a non-identifying relationship if the weak entity is non-ID-dependent
    * Represented by a *dashed* line
    * Also used between strong entities

#### Weak Entity Identifier: Non-ID-dependent
* All ID-dependent entities are weak entities, but there are other entities that are weak but not ID-dependent
* A non-ID-dependent weak entity may have a single or compostite key, but the key of the parent entity will be a *foreign key* within the weak entity


### Subtype Entities
* A subtype entity is a special case of another entity (which is called its subquery)
* An attribute of  the supertype may be used to indicate which of the subtypes is appropriate for a given instance -- This attribute is called a discriminator
* Subtypes can be *exclusive* or *inclusive*
    * If exclusive, the supertype relates to at most one subtype
    * If inclusive, the supertype can relate to one or more subtypes

### Subtype Entities Identifier
* The identifier of a supertype and all of its subtypes is the same attribute
* The relationships that connect subtypes and subtypes can be IS-A relationships if a subtype is the same entity as the supertype
    * An instance of the subtype inherts all of the properties of its supertype


### Recursive Relationships
* As noted earlier, it is possible for an entity to have a (unary) relationship to itself -- this is called a *recursive relationship*
* Recursion can be used to implement hierarchical relationships
