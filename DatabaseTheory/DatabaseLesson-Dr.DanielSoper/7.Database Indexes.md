## Introduction
* Indexes are one of the most important and useful tools for achieving high performance in a relational database
    * Many database administrators consider indexes to be *the single most critical tool* for improving database performance
* An index is a data structure that contains a copy of some of the data from one or more existing database tables
    * Like an index at the back of a textbook, a database index provides an organizational framework that the DBMS can use to quickly locate the information that it needs
    * This can vastly improve the speed with which MySQL queries can be answered


### Indexes - An Intuitive Overview
直觀概覽

#### Scene1
* Consider the *randomly ordered* table of names shown to the right..
* If we start at the top and examine one row at a time, how many rows will we need to examine before we find a randomly selected name?
* What is the *average* search time if this process is repeated many times?
* What is the *maximum* search time?

#### Scene2
* Consider the *alphabetically ordered* table of names shown to the right..
* If our objective is to minimize the number of rows that need to be examined in order to find a randomly chosen name, what search process could we use?
* What is the *average* search time if this process is repeated many times? (log2(n)-1)
* What is the *maximum* search time? (logx(n))

## Index Concepts
* Indexes are created on one or more columns in a table
    * For example:
    1. An index is created on a PK column
    2. The index will contain the PK value for each row in the table, along with each row's ordinal position (row number) within the table
    3. When a query involving the PK is run, the DBMS will find the PK value within the index. The DBMS will then know the postion of the row within the table
    4. The DBMS can then quickly locate the row in the table that is associated with the PK value
* Without an index, the DBMS has to perform a table scan in order to locate the desired row(s)
* An index can be created on most, but not all, columns
    * Whether an index can be created on a column depends on the column's data type
        * Columns with large object(LOB) data types cannot be indexed without employing additional mechanisms (such as a hash algorithm). These LOB data types includes:
            * text
            * ntext
            * image
            * varchar(max)
            * nvarchar(max)
            * varbinary(max)
* Creating an index increases the amount of storage space required by the database
    * This occurs because an index contains a copy of some of the data in a table
    * To estimate the storage space requirements of an index, use the following formula:
        * Number of rows in table x Average number of bytes required per row for the indexed column(s)
        * For example:
            * We want to create an index on two columns, *lastName* and *deptId*, where:
                * Values stored in *lastName* require an average of 16 bytes/rew
                * Values stored in *deptId* require an average of 2 bytes/row
                * The table contains 98,000 rows
            * The index will require about 98000 x (16+2) = 1764000 bytes of storage space



### B-Tree Index
* The commonest type of index uses a B-tree (balanced tree) structure
* B-trees use *pointers* and several layers of *nodes* in order to quickly locate desired data
    * Root node
    * Intermediate nodes
    * Leaf nodes
* When the DBMS processes a query which includes an indexed column, it starts at the root node of the B-tree and navigates downward until if finds the desired leaf


### Clustered Indexed
* In a clustered index, the actual data rows that comprise the table are stored at the leaf level of the index
* The indexed values are stored in a sorted order (either ascending or descending)
    * This means that there can be only one clustered index per table
        * PK columns are good candidates for clustered indexes

### Nonclustered Indexes
* In a nonclustered index, the leaf nodes contain the values from the indexed column(s), along with a row locator which points to the location of the actual data row
    * The actual data row might be stored in a leaf node of a clustered index or in a *heap*
        * A heap is just an ordinary table does not use a clustered index
* Nonclustered indexes are slower than clustered indexes because the DBMS must follow a pointer to retrieve the actual data row
* Unlike clustered indexes a table can have more than one nonclustered  index
* The leaf nodes of a nonclustered index can optionally contain values from non-indexed columns
    * Using this approach, the DBMS may be able to answer a query without ever needing to look at the actual data row itself!

### Other Types of Indexes
#### Bitmap Index
* In a bitmap index, a table is created with the values of one attribute along the horizontal axis and the values of another attribute along the vertical axis
* A bit value (1 or 0) in each cell within the table indicates whether the value of one attribute is associated with a value of the other attribute
* Bitmap indexes work best when one or both of the attributes has only a small number of unique values
* When used properly, a bitmap index can require only 25% of the disk space and can be 10 times faster than a tree-based index


#### Hashed Index
* In a hashed index, a hashing algorithm is used in order to convert an input value into a location within an index (such as a B-tree index), which in turn contains or points to the actual data row
* Hash indexes are useful in several situation, including:
    * In a parallel procession or distributed database environment
    * When a need exist to index complex objects (such as images)

## Index Considerations
* Since an index can consume a lot of storage space, indexes should only be created on columns that are involved in common queries
    * This means that a database designer must have knowledge of the queries that the DBMS will commonly process in order to design an indexing strategy
* Indexes should be used sparingly on tables that are updated frequently
    * Whenever an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation affects an indexed column, the index for the column must be rebuilt
        * Rebuilding an index takes time, and an index which is rebuilt often can actually slow the overall performance of the database

## Indexing Guidelines
* If a table is heavily updated, index *as few columns as possible*
    * Do not over-index heavily updated tables
* If a table is updated rarely, use as many indexed columns as necessary to achieve maximum query performance
* Clustered indexes are best used on columns that do not allow null values and whose values are unique
    * PK columns are therefore good targets for clustered indexes
* The performance benefits of an index are related to the uniqueness of the values in the indexed column
    * Index performance is poor when an indexed column contains a large proportion of duplicate values
    * Index performance is best when an indexed column unique values
