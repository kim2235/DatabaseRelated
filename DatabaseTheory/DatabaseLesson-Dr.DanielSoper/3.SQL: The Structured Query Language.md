## Structured Query Language
* Structured Query Language
    * Acronym: SQL
    * Pronounced *Sequel* or *S-Q-L*
    * Originally developed by IBM as the SQUEL language in the 1970s
    * Designed to support Edgar Codd's relational model Shared Data Banks. Communications of the ACM, 13(6): 377-387
    * Based no relational algebra
    * ANSI / ISO standard

---
## SQL Defined
* SQL is not a programming language, but rather is a data sub-language
* SQL is comprised of
    * A data definition language (DDL)
        * Used to define and manage database structures
    * A data manipulation language (DML)
        * Data definition and updating
        * Data retrieval (Queries)
    * A data control language (DCL)
        * For creating user accounts, managing permissions, etc

### SQL for Data Definition
* The SQL data definition statements include
    * CREATE
        * To create database objects
    * ALTER
        * To modify the structure and/or characteristics of existing database objects
    * DROP
        * To delete existing database objects

#### SQL for Data Definition: CREATE
* Creating database tables
    * The SQL CREATE TABLE statement

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    empId   Integer     NOT NULL,
    empName     Char(25)    NOT NULL
);
```

##### CREATE with CONSTRAINT1
* Creating database tables with PRIMARY KEY constraints
    * The SQL CREATE TABLE statement
    * The SQL CONSTRAINT keyword

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    empId   Integer     NOT NULL,
    empName     Char(25)    NOT NULL
    CONSTRAINT      empPK   PRIMARY KEY(empID)
);
```

##### CREATE with CONSTRAINT2
* Creating database tables with composite primary keys using PRIMARY KEY constraints
    * The SQL CREATE TABLE statement
    * The SQL CONSTRAINT keyword

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeShill (
    empId   Integer     NOT NULL,
    skillID Integer     NOT NULL,
    skillLevel  Integer     NULL,
    CONSTRAINT      empSkillPK   PRIMARY KEY(empID,skillID)
);
```

##### CREATE with CONSTRAINT3
* Creating database tables using PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints
    * The SQL CREATE TABLE statement
    * The SQL CONSTRAINT keyword

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeShill (
    empId   Integer     NOT NULL,
    skillID Integer     NOT NULL,
    skillLevel  Integer     NULL,
    CONSTRAINT  empSkillPK  PRIMARY KEY(empID,skillID),
    CONSTRAINT  empFK  FOREIGN KEY(empID)  REFERENCES  Employee(empID),
    CONSTRAINT  skillFK  FOREIGN KEY(skillID)  REFERENCES  Skill(skillID)
);
```

##### CREATE with CONSTRAINT4
* Creating database tables using PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints
    * The SQL CREATE TABLE statement
    * The SQL CONSTRAINT keyword
    * ON UPDATE CASCADE and ON DELETE CASCADE

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeShill (
    empId   Integer     NOT NULL,
    skillID Integer     NOT NULL,
    skillLevel  Integer     NULL,
    CONSTRAINT  empSkillPK  PRIMARY KEY(empID,skillID),
    CONSTRAINT  empFK  FOREIGN KEY(empID)  REFERENCES  Employee(empID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT  skillFK  FOREIGN KEY(skillID)  REFERENCES  Skill(skillID)  ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

#### ALTER
##### ALTER1: Primary Key Constraint
* Adding primary key constraints to an existing table
    * The SQL ALTER statement
```sql
ALTER TABLE Dmployee
    ADD CONSTRAINT empPK PRIMARY KEY(empID)
```


##### ALTER2: Composite Primary Key Constraint
* Adding a composite primary key constraint to an existing table
    * The SQL ALTER statemtn

```sql
ALTER TABLE EmployeeSkill
    ADD CONSTRAINT empSkillPK
        PRIMARY KEY(empID, skillID);
```


##### ALTER3: ForeignKey Constraint
* Adding foreign key constraints to an existing table
    * The SQL ALTER statement

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee
    ADD CONSTAINT empFK FOREIGN KEY(depID)
        REFERENCES Department(deptID);
```

### Modifying Data using SQL
* INSERT INTO
    * Will add a new row to a table
* UPDATE
    * Will update the rows in a table which match the specific criteria
* DELETE FROM
    * Will delete the rows in a table which match the specific criteria

#### AddingData: INSERT INTO
* To add a row to an existing table, use the INSERT INTO statement
* Non-numeric data must be enclosed in single quotes `'`

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee (empId, salaryCode, lastName) VALUES (62, 11, 'Halpert');
```

#### Changing Data Values: UPDATE
* To change the data values in an existing row (or a set of rows) use the UPDATE statement

```sql
UPDATE  Employee
SET     phone = '657-278-1234'
WHERE   empId = 29;

UPDATE  Employee
SET     deptID = 4
WHERE   empName LIKE 'Da%';

UPDATE  Employee
SET     detpId = 3;
```

#### DeletingData: DELETE
* To delete a row (or a set of rows) from a table use the DELETE FROM statement

```sql
DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE   empId = 29;

DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE   empName LIKE 'Da%';

DELETE FROM Employee;
```

#### SQL for DATA Retrieve: Queries
* SELECT is the best known SQL statement
* SELECT will retrieve information from the database that matches the specific criteria using a SELECT/FROM/WHERE framework

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   empID = 33;

SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee;
```

##### The Resultset is a Relation
* A query pulls information from one or more relations and creates (temporarily) a new relation
* This allows a query to:
    * Create a new relation
    * Feed information into another query (as a *subquery*)
    * The resultset may not be in 3NF
        * Especially when performing a *join*

##### Displaying Multiple Columns
* To show values for two or more specific columns, use a aomma-seperated list of column names

```sql
SELECT  empId, empName
FROM    Employee;
```

##### Displaying All Columns
* To show all of the column values for the rows that match the specific criteria, use an asterisk (`*`)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM    Employee;
```

##### Displaying Each Row Only Once
* The DISTINCT keyword may be added to the SELECT statement to suppress the display of duplicate rows

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT depId
FROM Employee;
```

##### Specifying Search Criteria
* The WHERE clause Specifies the matching or filter criteria for the records (rows) that are to be displayed

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   deptId = 15;
```

##### Match Criteria
* WHERE clause comparisons may include
    * Equals `=`
    * Not Equals `<>` or `!=`
    * Greater than `>`
    * Less than `<`
    * Greater than or Equal to `>=`
    * Less than or Equal to `<=`

##### Match Operators
* Multiple matching criteria may be specified by useing
    * AND
        * Representing an intersection of the data sets
    * OR
        * Representing a union of the data sets
    * Concetps such as "intersection" and "union" are derived from relational algebra
        * Venn diagrams!

Operator Examples

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   deptId < 7 OR deptId > 12;

SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   deptId = 9 AND salaryCode <= 3;
```

##### A List of Values
* The WHERE clause may include the IN keyword to specify that a particular column value must match one of the values in a list
    * This is much more convenient than using a series of "OR" operator
    * Compare to:

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   deptId  IN  (4,8,9);

WHERE   deptId = 4 OR deptId = 8 OR deptId = 9;
```

##### The Logical NOT Operator
* Any criteria statement can be presented by a NOT operator in order to invert the resultset
    * Using NOT will return all information *except* the information matching the specified criteria

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   deptId NOT IN (4, 8, 9);
```

##### Finding Data in a Range of Values
* SQL provide a BETWEEN keyword that allows a user to specify a minimum and maximum value on one line
    * BETWEEN is inclusive!!
    * Compare to:

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   salaryCode BETWEEN 10 AND 45;

WHERE   salaryCode >= 10 and salaryCode <= 45;
```

##### Wildcard Searches
* The SQL LIKE keyword allow for searches on partial data values
* LIKE can be paired with wildcards to find rows that partially match a string value
    * The multiple character wildcard character is a percent sign (`%`)
    * The single character wildcard character is an underscore (`_`)

```sql
SELECT  empId
FROM    Employee
WHERE   empName     LIKE    'Da%'


SELECT  empId
FROM    Employee
WHERE   phone   LIKE    '657-278-____'
```

##### Sorting the Resultset
* Query reults may by sorted using the ORDER BY clause
    * Ascending vs. descending sorts

Default is ascending

```sql
SELECT  *
FROM    Employee
ORDER BY    empName;
```

##### Bulit-in Numeric Functions
* SQL provides serveral built-in numberic functions
    * COUNT
        * Count the number of rows that match the specific criteria
    * NIN
        * Finds the minimum value for a specific column for those rows match the criteria
    * MAX
        * Finds the maximum value for a specific column for those rows match the criteria
    * SUM
        * Calculates the sum (total) for a specific column for those rows match the criteria
    * AVG
        * Calculates the numerical average (mean) of a specific column for those rows match the criteria
    * STDEV
        * Calculate the standard deviation of the values in a numeric column whose rows match the criteria

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FRON    Employee;

SELECT MIN(hours) AS minimumHour,
        MAX(hours) AS maximumHour,
        AVG(hours) AS averageHour
FROM    Project
WHERE   ProjID > 7;
```

##### Providing Subtotals: GROUP BY
* Categorized results can be retrieved using the GROUP BY clause
```sql
SELECT  deptId,
        count(*) AS numberOfEmployees
FROM    Employee
GROUP BY    deptId;
```

##### Providing Subtotals: GROUP BY with Having
* The HAVING clause may optionally be used with a GROUP BY in order to restrict which categories are displayed

```sql
SELECT  salespersonId, salepersonLastName,
        SUM(slleAmount) AS totalSales
FROM    Sales
GROUP BY    salespersonId, salepersonLastName
HAVING      SUM(saleAMount) >= 10000;
```

### Retrieving Information from Multiple Tables
#### Subqueries
* As stated earlier, the result of a query ia a *relation*. The results from one que ry may therefore be used as input for another query. This is called a *subquery*
    * Noncorrelated subqueries
    * Correlated subqueries

##### Noncorrelated Subquery Example
* In a noncorrelated subquery, the inner query only needs to run once in order for the database engine to solve the problem

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee
WHERE   deptId  IN
        (SELECT deptId
        FROM    Department
        WHERE   deptName  LIKE  'Account%');
```

##### Correlated Subquery Example
* In a correlated subquery, the inner query needs to be run repeatedly in order for the database engine to solve the problem
    * The inner query needs a value form the outer query in order to run

```sql
SELECT  empName
FROM    Employee e
WHERE   empSalary >
        (SELECT AVG(empSalary)
            FROM    Employee
            WHERE   deptId = e.deptId);
```

#### Joins
* ANother way of combining data from multiple tables is by using a *join*

| Outer Join | Inner Join |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Left Outer Join`, `Full Outer Join`, `Right Outer Join` |  |


##### WHERE Clause Inner Join Example
```sql
SELECT  empName, deptName
FROM    Employee AS E, Department AS D
WHERE   E.deptId = D.deptId;
```

##### JOIN...ON Example
* The JOIN...ON syntax can be also be used to perform a join
* It has the advantage of moving the JOIN syntax into the FROM clause

```sql
SELECT  empName, deptName
FROM    Employee e INNER JOIN Department d
        ON  e.deptId = d.deptId
WHERE   d.deptName NOT LIKE 'Account%';
```

##### LEFT OUTER JOIN Example
* The OUTER JOIN syntax can be used to obtain data that exists in one table without matching data in the other table

```sql
SELECT  empName, deptName
FROM    Employee e LEFT OUTER JOIN Department d
        ON  e.deptId = d.deptId;
```

##### RIGHT OUTER JOIN Example
* The unmatched data displayed can come from each table, depending on whether a RIGHT OUT JOIN or a LEFT OUT JOIN is used

```sql
SELECT  empName, deptName
FROM    Employee e RIGHT OUTER JOIN Department d
        ON e.depId = d.deptID;
```

##### FULL OUTER JOIN Example
* The unmatched data from either table are inclued in the results if a FULL OUTER JOIN is used

```sql
SELECT  empName, deptName
FROM    Employee e
        FULL OUTER JOIN Department d
        ON e.depId = d.deptID;
```


### Deleting Database Objects: DROP
* To remove unwanted database objects from database, use the SQL DROP statement
* Warning... The DROP statement will permanently remove the object and all of its associated data

```sql
DROP TABLE Employee;
```

#### Removing a Constraint: ALTER&DROP
* To change the constraints on existing tables, you may need to remove the existing constraints before new constraints can be added   

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee DROP CONSTRAINT empFK;
```

### The CHECK Constraint
* The CHECK constraint can be used to create restrictions on the values that are allowed to appear in a column

```sql
ALTER TABLE Project
    ADD CONSTRAINT projectCheckDates
        CHECK (startDate < endDate);
```

## SQL Views
* A SQL View is a *virtual table* created by a DBMS-stored SELECT statement which can combine access to data in multiple tables and even in other views

```sql
CREATE VIEW SalesDepartment AS
SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE deptId = (SELECT deptId FROM Department WHERE deptName='Sales');
```

* You can run a query against a view in the same way that you run a query against a table

```sql
SELECT empName FROM Salesdepartment;
```
