## Control, Security, and Reliability
* Three of the most critical database administration functions are:
    * Concurrency control
    * Security
    * Backup and Recovery

### Concurrency Control
* Concurrency
    * People or applications may try to update the same information at the same time
* Interdependency
    * Changes requested by one user may impact others
* Concurrency control ensures that one user's actions do not adversely impact another user's actions
* At the core of concurrency is accessibility
    * In one extreme, data become inaccessible once a user `touch` the data
        * This ensures that data that are being considered for update are not readable by other users
    * In the other extreme, data are always readable
        * The data are even readable when they are locked for update

#### Concurrent Processing Example
* User A
    * Read Item 100
    * Change Item 100
    * Write Item 100
* User B
    * Read Item 200
    * Change Item 200
    * Write Item 200

Order of processing at database server
1. Read Item 100 for A
2. Read Item 200 for B
3. Change Item 100 for A
4. Write Item 100 for A
5. Change Item 200 for B
6. Write Item 200 for B

### Need for Atomic Operations
* A database transaction typically involved several Operations
* These operations are atomic and are sometimes called `logical units of work` (LUW)
* Before a transaction is committed to the database, a LUW must be successfully completed
    * If one or more LUW is unsuccessful, a rollback is preformed and no changes are saved to the database


### Lost Update Problem
* If two or more users are attempting to update the same datum at the same time, it is possible for one update overwrite in other update

#### Lost Update Problem Example
* User A
    * Read Item 100 (assume item count is 10)
    * Reduce count of items by 5
    * Write Item 100
* User B
    * Read Item 100 (assume item count is 10)
    * Reduce count of items by 3
    * Write Item 100

Order of processing at database server
1. Read Item 100 for A
2. Read Item 100 for B
3. Set item count to 5 for A
4. Write Item 100 for A
5.  Set item count to 7 for A
6. Write Item 100 for B

Note: The change and write in steps 3 and 4 are lost


### Concurrency Issues
* Dirty reads
    * The transaction reads a modified record that has not yet been committed to the database
* Inconsistent reads
    * The transaction re-reads a data set and finds that the data have changed
* Phantom reads
    * The transaction re-reads a data set and finds that a new record has been added

### Resource Locking
* To avoid concurrency issues, resource locking is used to disallow transactions from reading, updating, and/or writing to a data set that is in use


#### Implicit versus Explicit Resource Locking
* Implicit locks are issued automatically by the DBMS based on an activity
* Explicit locks are issued by users requesting exclusive rights to specified data
    * Table locks
    * Row locks
    * Column locks
    * Cell locks

#### Concurrent Processing with Explicit Locking Example
* User A
    * Lock item 100
    * Read Item 100 (assume item count is 10)
    * Reduce count of items by 5
    * Write Item 100
* User B
    * Lock item 100
    * Read Item 100 (assume item count is 10)
    * Reduce count of items by 3
    * Write Item 100

Order of processing at database server
1. Lock item 100 for A
2. Read item 100 for A
3. Lock item 100 for B; cannot, so place B in wait state
4. Set item count to 5 for A
5. Write item 100 for A
6. Release A's lock on item 100
7. Place lock on item 100 for B
8. Read item 100 for B
9. Set item count to 2 for B
10. Write item 100 for B
11. Release B's lock on item 100


### Serializable Transactions
* When two or more transactions are processed concurrently, the results in the database should be logically consistent with the results that would have been achieved had the transactions been processed in an arbitrary serial fashion
* A scheme for processing concurrent transactions in this way is said to be serializable


### Deadlock
* As a transaction begins to lock resources, it may have to wait for a particular resource to be released by another transaction
* On occasion, two transactions may indefinitely wait on each another to release resources
    * This condition is known as deadlock

#### Deadlock Example
* User A
    * Lock paper
    * Take paper
    * Lock pencils
* User B
    * Lock pencils
    * Take pencils
    * Lock paper

Order of processing at database server
1. Lock paper for User A
2. Lock pencils for User B
3. Process A's requests; write paper
4. Process B's requests; write pencil
5. Put A in wait state for pencils
6. Put B in wait state for paper
7.  `Locked`


### Optimistic Locking versus Pessimistic Locking
#### Optimistic Locking
* Read data
* Process transaction
* Issue update
* Look for conflict
* IF no conflict occurred
    * THEN commit transaction
* ELSE rollback and repeat transaction

Many SELECTs, Few INSERTs, UPDATEs or DELETEs


#### Pessimistic Locking
* Lock required resources
* Read data
* Process transaction
* Commit changes
* Release locks

Many INSERTs, UPDATEs or DELETEs


## Consistent Transactions
* Consistent transactions are often referred to by the acronym ACID
    * Atomic
    * Consistent
    * Isolated
    * Durable


### ACID:Atomic
* An atomic transaction is one in which all of the database actions occur or none of them does
* A transaction consists of a series of steps. Each step must be successfully for the transaction to be saved
* This ensures that the transaction completes everything it intended to do before saving the changes

### ACID:Cosnsistent
* A transaction is consistent if no other transactions are permitted on the records until the current transaction finished its tasks
* This ensures that the transaction integrity has statement level consistency among all records

### ACID:Isolation
* Within multiuser database environments, different transactions may be operation on the same data at the same time
* As such, the sequencing of uncommitted updates, rollbacks, and commits continuously changes the data content
* The ANSI SQL standard defines four isolation levels that specify which of the concurrency control problems are allowed to occur
    * READ UNCOMMITTED  (least restrication)
    * READ COMMITTED
    * REPEATABLE READ
    * SERIALIZABLE      (most restrication)


### ACID: Durable
* A durable transaction is one in which all committed changes are permanent


## Cursors
* A cursor is a pointer into a set of rows that is the result set from a  SQL SELECT statement
* Result sets can be very large, so applications and websites often can not work with the entire result set as a single unit  
* Cursors allow a result set to be processed one row at a time
* Cursors are commonly defined using SELECT statement

```sql
DECLARE CURSOR LargePurchases AS
    SELECT *
    FROM    Sale
    WHERE   purchasePrice >= 10000;
```

### Cursor Types
Conceptually, there are two major types of cursors:

1. Forward-only cursors (non-scrollable)
    * Rows fetched serially form the start to the end of the cursor
    * Rows are not retrieved from the database until they are fetched
        * The effects of any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements that affect rows in the result set are visible as the rows are fetched from the cursor
    * The cursor cannot be scrolled backward
        * Changes made to a row in the database after the row has been fetched are not visible through the cursor
2. Scrollable cursors
    * The cursor can scroll both forward and backward through the result set as needed to examine rows
    1. Static cursors
    2. Keyset cursors
    3. Dynamic cursors


#### Scrollable Cursor Types
* Static cursor (snapshot cursor)
    * The complete result set is retrieved and stored in a temporary table when the cursor is opened
    * The data in the result set always appear as they did at the moment when the cursor was opened
        * Any changes made to the underlying data (e.g. var INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements) are not visible through the cursor
    * Static cursors consume comparatively few system resources while scrolling

* Keyset Cursor
    * The keys for the rows in the results set are retrieved and stored in a temporary table when the cursor is opened
    * When the cursor scrolls to a row, the key is used to fetch the current data values for that row from the database
        * Updates made to a row after the cursor was opened are therefore visible through the cursor
        * Rows in the result set that have been deleted after the cursor was opened can also be identified through the cursor

* Dynamic cursor
    * All changes made to the rows in the result set are visible when scrolling through the cursor
        * All UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statement made by all users are visible
    * The data values, rows, and order of rows in the result set can change on each fetch
    * Opposite of a static cursor
    * Dynamic cursors consume a comparatively large quantity of system resources while scrolling

## Database Security
Database Security strives to ensure that only authenticated users perform authorized activities

### Processing Rights and Responsibilities
* Precessing rights define:
    * Who is permitted to perform certain actions
    * When certain actions are allowed to be performed
* The individuals performing these activities have full responsibility for the implications of their actions
* Individuals are authenticated via a username and a password

### Granting Permissions
* Databas Users are known both as an individual and as a member of one or more *roles*
    * Access and data rights/privileges may be granted to an individual and/or a role
* Permissions grant, deny, or revoke a user's ability to interact with specific database objects
* Users possess the compilation of permissions granted to the individual and all the roles for which they are members
    * A user receives the *union* of all of the permissions granted, denied, or revoked by their individual permissions and role permissions
    * If a conflict exists between individual and role permissions, then:
        * A `deny` permission at any level always take precedence
        * Aside from `denies`, role permission take precedence over individual permissions

### SQL Server Database Roles
* Database roles can be either flexible or fixed
    * Flexible roles are custom roles that are defined by the database administrator
    * Fixed roles are predefined roles to which database users can be assigned

## Database Security Guidelines
* Run the DBMS behind a firewall
* Apply the latest operating system and DBMS service packs and patches
* Limit DBMS functionality to needed features
* Physically protect the computer(s) and run(s) the DBMS
* Manage accounts and passwords carefully

## Database Backup and Recovery
* Common causes of database failures
    * Hardware failures
    * Programming bugs
    * Human errors/mistakes
    * Malicious actions
* Since these issues are impossible to completely avoid recovery procedures are essential.


### Reprocessing
* In reprocessing, all activities since the last backup was performed are redone by humans
* This is a brute-force technique
* This procedure is costly in the effort involved in re-entering the data
* This procedure is risky in that human error is likely and in that paper record-keeping may not be accurate

### Recovery via Rollback and Rollforward
* Most database management system provide a mechanism to record activities into a log file
* The log file is used for recovery via rollback or rollforward
    * To **undo** a transaction the log must contain a copy of every database record before it was change
        * Such records are called `before-images`
        * A transaction is undone by applying before-images of all its changes to the database
    * To **redo** a transaction the log must contain a copy of every database record (or page) after it was changed
        * These records are called `after-images`
        * A transaction is redone by applying after-images of all its changes to the database


#### Rollback
* Log files save activities in sequence order
* It is possible to undo activities by applying before-images to reverse database changes
* This is performed to correct/undo erroneous or malicious transaction(s) after a database is recovered from a full backup

#### Rollforward
* Activities recorded in the log files may be replayed
* In doing so, all activities are re-application to the database
* This procedure is used to restore database data by adding transactions to the last full backup


---
## Additional DBA Responsibilities
* The DBA needs to ensure that a mechanism exists to gather and record user reported errors and other problems
    * A means needs to be devised to prioritize those errors and problems and to ensure that they are corrected accordingly
* The DBA needs to create and manage a process for controlling the database configuration
    * Procedures for recording change requests
    * Conducting user and developer reviews of such requests
    * Creating projects and tasks
* The DBA is responsible for ensuring that appropriate documentation is maintained
    * Database structure
    * Concurrency control
    * Security
    * Backup and recovery
    * Applications used

---
## Distributed Database Processing
* A database is distributed when it is
    * Partitioned
    * Replication
    * Both partitioned and replicated
* This is fairly straightforward for read-only replicas, but it can be very difficult for other installations


---
## Object-Relational Database Management
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on objects, and OOP is now used as the basis of many computer programming languages
    * Java
    * VB.net
    * C++
    * C#


### Objects
* Object classes have
    * Identifiers
    * Properties
        * These are data items associated with the object
    * Methods
        * These are algorithms that allow the object to perform tasks
* The only substantive difference between entity classes and object classes is the presence of methods

#### Object Persistence
* Object persistence means that values of object properties are storable and retrievable
* Object persistence can be achieved by various techniques
    * A common technique is database technology
    * Relational databases can be used, but require substantial programming

#### OODBMS
* Object-Oriented DBMSs (OODBMSs) have been developed, but have not achieved widespread commercial success
    * It would be too expensive to transfer existing data from relational and other legacy databases
    * Therefore, OODBMSs are typically considered unjustifiable from a cost perspective


#### Object-Relational DBMSs
* The current SQL standard includes several object-oriented features
    * User-defined structured types
    * Inheritance
* Any database that supports the SQL standard can therefore be considered an object-relational database
* Most major database vendors support at least some object-oriented features
    * Oracle, DB2, SQL Server
