## Topic Objectives
* Know the potential problems with lists
* Understand the reasons for using a database
* Understand how related tables avoid the problems associated with lists
* Learn the components of a database system
* Learn the elements of a database
* Learn the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)
* Understand the functions of a database application

---
## Purpose
* The purpose of a database is:
    * To store data
    * To provide an organizational structure for data
    * To provide a mechanism for querying, creating, modifying, and deleting data
* A database can store information and relationships that are more complicated than a simple list

---
## Problems with Lists
### Redundancy
* In a list, each row is intended to stand on its own. As a result, the same information may be entered several times
    * For example, a list of projects may include the project manager's name, ID, and phone extension
        * If a particular person is currently managing 10 projects, his/her information would appear in the list 10 times
### Multiple Themes
* In a list, each row may contain information on more than one theme or business concept.
* As a result, certain information might appear in the list only if information about other themes or business concepts is also present
    * For example, a list of projects may include project manager information (Name, ID, and Phone Extension) and project information (ProjectName, ID, StartDate, Budget) in the same row

---
## List Modification Issues
* Redundancy and multiple themes in lists create modification problems
    * Deletion problems
    * Update problems
    * Insertion problems

---
## Addressing Information Complexities
* Relational database are designed to address many of the information complexity issues that arise in business

---
## Relational Databases
* A relational database stores information in tables. Each informational theme (business concept) is stored in its own table
* In essence, a relational database will break-up a list into several parts.
    * One part for each theme in the list
    * For example, a Project List might be divided into a CUSTOMER Table, a PROJECT Table, and a PROJECT_MANAGER Table

### Putting the Pieces Back Together
* In our relational database example, we broke apart our list into several tables. Somehow the tables must be *joined* back togeher
* In a relational database, tables are joined together using matched pairs of data values
    * For example, if a PROJECT has a CUSTOMER, the Customer_ID can be stored as a column in the PROJECT table. Whenever we need information about a customer, we can use the Customer_ID to look up the customer information in the CUSTOMER table.

---
## Sounds like More Work, Not Less
* A relational database is more complicated than a list
* However, a relational database minimizes data redundancy, preserves complex relationships among topics, and allows for partial data (*null* values)
* Furthermore, a relational database provides a solid foundation for creating user interface forms and reports

---
## The Structured Query Language (SQL)
* The Structured Query Language (SQL) is an international standard language for creating, processing, and querying databases and their tables
* The vase majority of data-driven applications and websites use SQL to retrieve format, report, insert, delete, and/or modify data for users

### SQL Example
* We can use SQL to combine the data in the three tables in the Art Course Database to recreate the original list structure of the data
    * We do this by using a SQL *SELECT* statement

```sql
SELECT  Customer.customerLastName,
        Customer.customerFirstName,
        Customer.phone,
        Course.courseDate, Enrollment.amountPaid,
        Course.course, Course.fee
FROM    Customer, Enrollment, Course
WHERE   Customer.customerNumber = Enrollment.customerNumber
AND     Course.courseNumber = Enrollment.courseNumber;
```

---
## Database Systems
* The four components of a database system are:
    * Users
    * Database Application(s)
    * Database Management Systems (DBMS)
    * Database

### Users
* A user of a database system will:
    * Use a database application to keep track of information
    * Use different user interface forms to enter, read, delete, and query data
    * Produce reports

### The Database
* A database is a *self-describing* collection of *related* records
* Self-describing:
    * The database itself contains the definition of its structure
    * *Metadata* are data describing the structure of the data in the database
* Table within a relational database are related to each other in some way

#### Database Contents
* User data
* Metadata
* Indexes and other overhead data
* Application metadata

---
## Database Management System (DBMS)
* A `database management system` (DBMS) serves as an intermediary between database applications and the database
* The DBMS manages and controls database activities
* The DBMS creates, processes, and administers the databases it controls

### Functions of a DBMS
* Create databases
* Create tables
* Create supporting structures
* Read database data
* Modify database data (insert, update, delete)
* Enforce rules
* Control concurrency
* Provide security
* Perform data backup and recovery

---
## Referential Integrity Constraints
* A DBMS can enforce many constraints
* Referential integrity constraints ensure that the values of a column in one table are valid based on the values in another table
    * For example, if a 5 was entered as a CustomerID in the PROJECT table, a Customer having a CustomerID value of 5 **must** exist in the CUSTOMER table

## Database Applications
* A database application is a set of one or more computer programs or websites that server as an intermediary between the user and the DBMS


## Personal Database Systems
* Personal database systems typically:
    * Support one application
    * Have only a few tables
    * Are simple in design
    * Involve only one computer
    * Support one user at a time

## Enterprise-Level Database Systems
* Enterprise-Level database systems typically:
    * Support several users simultaneously
    * Support more than one application
    * Involve multiple computers
    * Are complex in design
    * Have many tables
    * Have many databases
