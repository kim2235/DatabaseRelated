## Conceptual foundation
### Entity
* An entity is something of importance of a user or organization that needs to be represented in a database
* An entity represents one theme, topic, or business concept
* In the entity-relationship model (Topic 04), entities are restricted to things that can be represented using a single table

### Relation
* A relation is a two-dimensional table that has specific characteristics
* The table dimensions, like a matrix, consist of rows and columns

#### Characteristics of a Relation
* Rows contain data about instance of an entity
* Columns contain data about attributes of an entity
* Cells of the table hold a single value
* All values in a column are of the same kind (data type)
* Each column has a unique name
* The order of the columns is unimportant
* The order of the rows is unimportant
* No two rows can be identical

## relations and non-relations
### A Sample Relation

| EmployeeNumber | FirstName | LastName |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 | Yousef | Hassan |
| 101 | Jerry | Cadley |
| 104 | Yi | Chang |
| 107 | Shir | Anavi |

### A Non-relation Example

| EmployeeNumber | Phone | LastName |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 101 | `335-6421, 454-9744` | Hassan |
| `100` | 215-7789 | Cadley |
| 104 | 610-9850 | Chang |
| 107 | 299-9090 | Anavi |
| `100` | 215-7789 | Cadley |


**All relations are tables, not all tables ar e relations.**


---
## Basic Relational Terminology
Synonyms...

| Table | Row | Column |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| File(rarely) | Record | Field |
| Relation | Tuple (rerely) | Attribute |


---
## Keys
* A key is on (or more) columns of a relation whose values are used to identify a row

### Uniqueness of Keys
| Unique Key | Nonunique Key |
| :--- | :--- |
| Data value is unique for each row. | Data value may be shared among several rows. |
| Consequently, the key will uniquely inendify a row. | Consequently, the key will identiry a set of rows. |


* Nonunique Key Example

| EmployeeID | Name | PhoneNumber | DepartmentID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 101 | Dan | 714-555-7270 | 1 |
| 102 | Fry | 657-555-6561 | `2` |
| 103 | Leela | 303-555-3247 | `2` |
| 104 | Bender | 480-555-4439 | `2` |

`DepartmentID` is Non-unique key


### Dan's Typology of Database Keys

| Unique Key | Nonunique Key |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Candidate key`, `Composite key`, `Primary key`, `Surrogate key` | `Foreign key` |

* Unique Key
    * `Candidate key`, `Composite key`, `Primary key`, `Surrogate key`
* Nonunique Key
    * `Foreign key`


### A Composite Key
* A composite key is a key that is composed of two or more attributes
* For a key to be unique, it must often become a composite key

#### Composite Key Example

| Flight Number | Date |
| :--- | :--- |
| UA 36 | 03 Sep 2016 |
| AA 704 | 31 Oct 2016 |
| UA 36 | 04 Sep 2016 |
| BA 9 | 31 Oct 2016 |

`Flight Number` + `Date` = Unique!

### A Candidate Key
* A candidate key is called `candidate` because it has the potential to become the primary key
* A candidate key is a unique


### A Primary Key
* A primary key is a candidate key chosen to be the main key for the relation
* If you know the value of the primary key, you will be able to uniquely identify a single row within the table

#### Primary Key Example

| EmployeeNumber | FirstName | LastName |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 | Yousef | Hassan |
| 101 | Jerry | Cadley |
| 102 | Yi | Chang |
| 107 | Shir | Anavi |

`EmployeeNumber` is Primary Key

### A Surrogate Key
* A surrogate key is a `unique`, `numeric value` that is added to a relation to serve as the primary key
* Surrogate key values have no meaning to users and are usually hidden on forms, querys, and reports
* A surrogate key is often used in place of a composite primary key

#### Surrogate Key Example
* Example1

| EmployeeNumber | FirstName | LastName |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 100 | Yousef | Hassan |
| 101 | Jerry | Cadley |
| 102 | Yi | Chang |
| 107 | Shir | Anavi |

`EmployeeNumber` is the primary key, but this type of primary key is called **`Surrogate key`**.


* Example2

| Flight ID | Flight Number | Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | UA 36 | 03 Sep 2016 |
| 2 | AA 704 | 31 Oct 2016 |
| 3 | UA 36 | 04 Sep 2016 |
| 4 | BA 9 | 31 Oct 2016 |

`Flight ID` = `Flight Number` + `Date` = Unique


### relationships Between Tables
* A table may be related to other tables
* For example
    * An Employee works in a Department
        * Each employee just work in a department, but a department may contains many emplyees
    * A Manager controls a Project

---
## A Foreign Key
* To establish relationships, we need to implement a foreign key
* A foreign key is a primary key from one table that is placed into another table

### Foreign Key Example
* example1
`Manager.ManagerID` is the Primary Key of table `Manager`, `Project.ManagerID` is a foreign key from `Manager.ManagerID`

* Example2
`Department.DeptID` is the Primary Key of table `Department`, `Employee.DeptID` is a foreign key from `Department.DeptID`


### Referential Integrity
* Referential integrity states that every value of a foreign key **must** match a value of an existing primary key

---
## Null Values
* A Null value means that no data exists
    * You can think of a null value as an empty cell in the table
* This is different from a zero, space character, empty string, or table character

### The Problem of Null Values
* A Null is often ambiguous. It could mean...
    * The column value is not appropriate for the specific row
    * The column value has not been decided
    * The column value is unknown
* Each may have entirely different implications


---
## Functional Dependency
* A relationship between attributes in which one attribute (or group of attributes) determines the value of another attribute in the same table
* Illustration...
    * The price of one delicious Girl Socut cookie can determine the price of a box of 12 cookies
        * (CookiePrice, Qty) --> BoxPrice

Virtual Column in MariaDB


### Determinants
決定因素

* The attribute (or attributes) that we use as the starting point (the variable on the left side of the equation) is called a *determinant*
    * (CookiePrice, Qty) --> BoxPrice, `CookiePrice` is a determinant


### Candidate/Primary Keys and Functional Dependency
* By definition...
    * A candidate key of a relation will functionally determine all other non-key attributes in the row
* Likewise, by definition...
    * A primary key of a relation will functionally determine all other non-key

#### Primary Key and Functional Dependency Example

```
(EmployeeID) ---> (EmpLastName,EmpPhone)

(ProjectID) ---> (ProjectName,StartDate)
```

---
## Data Normalization
* A process of analyzing a relation to ensure that it is *well formed*
* Normalization involves decompressing relations with anomalies to produce smaller, well-structured relations
* More specifically, if a relation is normalized (well-formed), rows can be inserted, deleted, or modified without creating anomalies


### Normalization Principles
* Relational design principles for normalized relations:
    * To be a well-formed relation, every *determinant* must be a *candidate key*
    * Any relation that is not well-formed should be broken into two or more well-formed relations!
* **TIP**: As a general rule, a well-formed relation will not encompass more than one business concept!

#### Normalization Example
```
(StudentID) ---> (StudentName, DormName, DormCost)

However, if...

(DormName)  --->  (DormCost)

Then DormCost should be placed into its own relation, resulting in the relations:

(StudentID) --->  (StudentName, DormName)
(DormName)  --->  (DormCost)
```

```
(SttorneyID, ClientID) ---> (ClientName, MeetingDate, Duration)

    However, if...
    (ClientID)  --->   (ClientName)

    Then ClientName should be placed into its own resulting in the relations:

(SttorneyID, ClientID) ---> (ClientName, MeetingDate, Duration)
    (ClientID)  --->   (ClientName)
```

### Normalization Steps

Table with multivalued attributes --> `Remove multivalued attributes` --> First normal form (1NF) --> `Remove partial dependencies` --> Second normal form (2NF) --> `Remove transitive dependencies` --> Third normal form (3NF)

### First Normal Form
* Table contains no multivalued attributes
    * Every attribute value is atomic
* The figure on the next slide is *not* in 1st
    * Normal Form (multivalued attributes) --> *it is not a relation*
* *All relations* are in 1st Normal Form


### Second Normal Form
* 1NF PLUS *every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the ENTIRE primary key*
    * Every non-key attribute must be defined by the entire key, not by only part of the key
    * No partial dependencies

### Third Normal Form
* 2NF PLUS *no transitive dependencies* (functional dependencies on non-primary-key attributes)
    * Such dependencies are called *transitive*, because the primary key is a determinant for another attribute, which in turn is a determinant for a third
* Solution: Non-key determinant with transitive dependencies goes into a new tables; non-key determinant becomes primary key in the new table and remains as a foreign key in the old table
