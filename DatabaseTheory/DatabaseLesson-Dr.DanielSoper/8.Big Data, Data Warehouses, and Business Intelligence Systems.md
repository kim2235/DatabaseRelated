## Topic Objectives
* Understand the basic concepts of data warehouses and data marts
* Understand the basic concepts and architecture of dimensional databases
* Learn about business intelligence (BI) systems
* Understand the basic concepts of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and data mining
* Learn about Big Data, the NoSQL movement, structured storage, and the MapReduce process

## Business Intelligence Systems
* Business intelligence (BI) systems are information systems thate:
    * Assist managers and other professionals in the analysis of current and past activities and in the prediction of future events
    * Do not directly support operational activities, such as the recording and processing of orders
        * These are supported by transaction processing systems
    * Support management assessment, analysis, planning, and control

### Types of BI Systems
* BI systems fall into two broad categories:
    * `Reporting systems` that sort, filter, group and make elementary calculations on operational data
    * `Data mining applications` that perform sophisticated analyses on data; analyses that usually involve complex statistical and mathematical processing

### Characteristics of Business Intelligence Applications
* Reporting
    * Filter, sort, group and make simple calculation
    * Summarize current status
    * Compare current status to past or predicted status
    * Classify entities (customers, products, employees, ets.)
    * Report delivery crucial
* Data Mining
    * Often employ sophisticated statistical and mathematical techniques
    * Used for:
        * What-if analyses
        * Predictions
        * Decisions
    * Results often incorporated into some other report or system

---
## Problems with Operational Data
* `Dirty Data`
    * Example - `V` as a gender code (instead of `M` or `F`)
    * Example - `213` for Age (in years)
* Missing Values
* Inconsistent Data
    * Example - data that have changed, such as a customer's phone number
* Nonintegrated Data
    * Example - data from two or more sources that need to be combined
* Incorrect Format
    * Example - time data stored as hours when needed in minutes
* Too Much Data
    * Example - An excessive number of columns


---
## ETL Data Transformation
* ETL = Extract, Transform, Load
* Data commonly need to be `cleaned` before they can be added to a data warehouse
    * To reconcile dirty, inconsistent, and nonintegrated data, handle missing values, etc.
* Data commonly need to be transformed before they can be added to a data warehouse
    * Example
        * {CountryCode -> CountryNname}
        * `US` -> `United States`
    * Example
        * Email address to Email domain
        * dan@dan.com -> `dan.com`

---
## Dimensional Databases
* A non-normalized database structure used for data warehouses
* May use slowly changing dimensions
    * Values change infrequently
        * Phone Number
        * Address
* Used to track historical data
    * Contain a Date or Time dimensions


| Operational Database | Dimensional Database |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Used for structured transaction data processing | Used for unstructured analytical data processing |
| Current data are used | Current and historical data are used |
| Data are inserted, updated, and deleted by users | Data are loaded and updated systematically, not by users |

* Normalized Operational Database
    * Fast data storage, slow data retrieval
* Non-Normalized Data Warehouse
    * Slow data storage, fast data retrieval

## OLAP and Data Mining
* `OnLine Analytical Processing` (OLAP) is a technique for dynamically examining database data
    * OLAP uses simple arithmetic functions such as Sum, Average, and Count
* Data Mining is a mathematically sophisticated technique for analyzing database data
    * Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques (not just simple functions, as with OLAP)

### OLAP
* OLAP systems produce an *OLAP* report, also known as an *OLAP cube*
* An OLAP report uses inputs called *dimensions*
* An OLAP report calculates outputs called *measures*

#### SQL Query for OLAP Data


```sql
SELECT      C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName, C.city,
            P.ProductNumber, P.ProductName,
            T.[Year], T.QuarterText,
            SUM(PS.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM        FUSTOMER C, PRODUCT_SALES PS, PRODUCT P, TIMELINE T
WHERE       C.CustomerID = PS.CustomerID
    AND     P.ProductNumber = PS.ProductNumber
    AND     T.TimeID = PS.TimeID
GROUP BY    C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName, C.City, P.ProductNumber, P.ProductName, T.QuarterText, T.[Year]
ORDER BY    C.CustomerName, T.[Year], T.QuarterText;
```

#### SQL View for OLAP Data


```sql
CREATE  VIEW    HADDWProductSalesView AS
SELECT      C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName, C.city,
            P.ProductNumber, P.ProductName,
            T.[Year], T.QuarterText,
            SUM(PS.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM        FUSTOMER C, PRODUCT_SALES PS, PRODUCT P, TIMELINE T
WHERE       C.CustomerID = PS.CustomerID
    AND     P.ProductNumber = PS.ProductNumber
    AND     T.TimeID = PS.TimeID
GROUP BY    C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName, C.City, P.ProductNumber, P.ProductName, T.QuarterText, T.[Year]
ORDER BY    C.CustomerName, T.[Year], T.QuarterText;
```


### Data Mining Applications
#### The Convergence of the Disciplines
* Huge Databases
* Data Mining
    * Statistics, Mathematics
    * Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
    * Data Management Technology
    * sophisticated Marketing, Finance, and Other Business Professionals
    * Inexpensive Computer Processing and Storage

#### Popular Data Mining Techniques
* `Cluster analysis`: Identifies groups of entities that have similar characteristics
* `Decision tree analysis`: Classifies entities into groups based on past history
* `Regression`: Produces mathematical equations that can be used to predict future events based on past observations
* `Neural Networks`: Use training data to learn how to create accurate predictions/estimates
* `Market Basket Analysis`: Determines patterns of associated buying behavior
    * Also known as *affinity analysis*

## Big Data
* The world is currently generating *many* exabytes of new data *every day*
    * 1 exabyte = 1,000,000 terabytes
* Big data refers to the rapidly expanding amount of data being stored and used by organizations
    * Large and complex datasets
    * Difficult to process using traditional database management tools or traditional data processing applications
    * Much of this big data is being generated by web 2.0 applications
* Big data presents many challenges
    * Data capture, maintenance (curation), storage, search, transfer, analysis, visualization, etc.

## The NoSQL Movement
* `NoSQL` is a movement toward using non-relational database in order to support huge and highly distributed / highly replicated collections of data
    * NoSQL = `Not only SQL`
* There are many different non-relational database architectures involved in the NoSQL movement
    * Key-value stores, wide columnar stores, document stores, graph-based stores, etc.
* Collectively, these databases are often referred to as structured storage
    * Simpler design than relational databases
    * Looser consistency models than relational databases
        * Often do not provide ACID guarantees

### Structured Storage - Apache Cassandra
* One of the most popular Structured storage database management systems is Apache Cassandra
    * Uses a hybrid key-value / wide column architecture
    * Originally created at Facebook, now open-source and free
    * Cross-platform support (witten in Java)
    * Supports massively distributed environments
    * Highly scalable and decentralized
        * All nodes (servers) have the same role -> no single point of failure
    * Automatic data replication
        * Highly fault tolerant -> individual nodes can fail with no downtime
    * Supports MapReduce
    * Used by CERN, Constant Contact, Digg, Instagram, Netflix, Reddit, Walmart, Twitter, etc.

### Structured Storage - Apache Cassandra
* In a relational DBMS, related data for an application are stored in a container known as a *daabase* or a *schema* which contains one or more *tables*
* In Cassandra, related data for an application are stored in a container known as a *keyspace* which contains one or more *column families*
    * Column families contain *column*
    * Column are comprised of a *name*, a value, and a *timestamp*
    * Related column are stored in the same *row*
    * Each row is identified by a unique row *key*
    * Rows are *not* required to contain the same set or number of columns!
    * There are no formal foreign key relationships between column families
    * Column families cannot be joined using queries (i.e., join operations  are not supported)

---
## Eventual Consistency
* In a structured storage architecture such as that used by Cassandra, data are commonly distributed and replicated across many nodes
    * Requests for data can be handled by the nearest available node that is able to service the request
* When a data item is updated on one node, it can take time for the update to cascade to other nodes within the cluster that contain a copy of the data
    * If the data value is requested from one of these other nodes in the interim, it will be out-of-date
* Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in replicated data environments which guarantees that if no new updates to a specific data item are made, eventually all requests for that data item will return the most up-to-date value
    * The timestamps recorded during each data item update allow for the reconciliation of inconsistencies


---
## The MapReduce Process
* `MpaReduce` is a programming model that relies on parallelization to perform data processing on huge datasets that are distributed across many servers
* Conceptually, MapReduce involeds two types of nodes(servers): `master nodes` and `worker nodes`
* In MapReduce, processing problems are solved using two broad steps:
    1. The **Map** step
        * The master node divides the problem into a series of sub-problems, which are then assigned to and carried out by worker nodes
    2. The **Reduce** step
        * After completing their assigned tasks, the worker nodes pass their results back to the master node. The master node then processes these results in order to produce the final answer to the  processing problem
